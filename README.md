PyDir is a program written in python that can be used to bruteforce websites to scan for directories. The goal is to add multithreading and concurrency to speed up the process by a lot.

Here all the things I would like to add to this particular project.

How to use:-

python PyDir.py -s

Enter the url, and scan away! 

use flag -q to print out only successful requests

To Do:-
1. Concurrency
2. Multithreading
3. GUI mode
4. Error handling
5. DoS attacks
6. Curl commands on websites
7. Web crawler
8. Compile to C
